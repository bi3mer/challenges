# FizzBuzz

I'm just trying to get a better handle on c++ so I figured I'd go back to the basics and work my way up so I can treat this language, and similar ones, like a tool. For starters I'm starting with the rather well known [FizzBuzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) challenge as a way to get started. It isn't meant to be difficult, just a starting place.

When I put in this "challenge" I didn't realize it was this simple.
