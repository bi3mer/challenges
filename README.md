# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementation to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Chalenges:

1. Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain 
2. Implement [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and graph results
3. Run [Keras](https://keras.io/) [q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) on [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) [CartPole Game](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) (working on)
4. Implement [trace search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search) in c++ (tentative)
5. Simple version of [Tanks](https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/81/268997-pockettanks.jpg), where the angle is determined by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed. Start with a plane but then generate some random terrain. (tentative)
6. [Dijkstra shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 2d visualization (tentative)
