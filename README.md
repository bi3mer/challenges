# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementations to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). You'll also notice that most of the c++ challenges are substantially easier than say the python or java challenges. This is because it is a language that I want to work on becuase memory management is something I have only encountered in theory. The result is that working in the language often takes a lot more time for me. So I'm starting small with c++ and hopefully in later challenges I'll use it with similar proficiency to python.

Chalenges:

0. <s>Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain</s>
1. <s>Implement [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and graph results</s>
2. <s>Run [q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) on [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) [CartPole Game](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) to balance the pole on the cart</s>
3. Implement [breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) in c++ (working on)
4. Solve XOR with smallest possible ANN in Keras
5. Implement [Dijkstra shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) in c++ 
6. Implement AlexNet in Keras and run on something like mnist
7. Implement GoogleNet in keras and run on something like mnist (run on something other than dataset used in challenge 6)
8. Repeat challenge002 with [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) scenario
9. Implement visualization of a [fractal tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index)
10. Implement solution to the [change-making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem). The first solution being something made up and the second being an optimal solution.
11. Implement [beam search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) in c++
12. Using [SerpentAI](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI) create an agent to play [Super Tux kart](https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page) and win
13. Simple version of [Tanks](https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/81/268997-pockettanks.jpg), where the angle is determined by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed. Start with a plane but then generate some random terrain.
