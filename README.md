# Challenges

This repository holds a set of implementation to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. 

Chalenges:

1. Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain (working on)
2. Dijkstra shortest path 2d visualization (tentative)
3. 2D Maze Generation with [Kruskal](link goes here) (tentative)
4. Simple version of [Tanks](link goes here), where the angle is determines by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed (tentative)
