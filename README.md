# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementation to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Chalenges:

0. Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain 
1. Implement [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and graph results
2. Run [q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) on [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) [CartPole Game](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) to balance the pole on the cart
3. Implement [trace search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search) in c++ (working on)
4. [Dijkstra shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 2d visualization (tentative)
5. Solve XOR with smallest possible ANN in Keras
6. Implement AlexNet in Keras and run on something like mnist
7. Implement GoogleNEt in keras and run on something like mnist
8. Repeate challenge002 with [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) scenario
9. Implement visualization of a [fractal tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index)
9. Simple version of [Tanks](https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/81/268997-pockettanks.jpg), where the angle is determined by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed. Start with a plane but then generate some random terrain. (tentative)
