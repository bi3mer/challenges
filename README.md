# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementations to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). You'll also notice that most of the c++ challenges are substantially easier than say the python or java challenges. This is because it is a language that I want to work on becuase memory management is something I have only encountered in theory. The result is that working in the language often takes a lot more time for me. So I'm starting small with c++ and hopefully in later challenges I'll use it with similar proficiency to python.

Chalenges:

2. <s>Run [q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) on [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) [CartPole Game](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) to balance the pole on the cart</s>
3. Implement [breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) in c++ (working on)
4. <s>Solve XOR with smallest possible ANN in Keras</s>
5. <s>Implement fizz buzz c++</s>

7. Implement AlexNet in Keras and run on something like mnist
8. Fibonacci sequence in mips or similar assembly language
9. Implement GoogleNet in keras and run on something like mnist (run on something other than dataset used in challenge 6)
10. <s>Reverse array in c++</s>
11. Repeat challenge002 with [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) scenario
12. Implement visualization of a [Hilbert Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve)
13. Implement solution to the [change-making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem). The first solution being something made up and the second being an optimal solution.
14. <s>Implement remove duplicates in an array and adjust the size c++</s>
15. Given a definition of a bipartite graph in a text file, find whether or not there exists a feasible matching for a scenario such as people to jobs
