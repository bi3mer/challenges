# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementation to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Chalenges:

1. Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain (working on)
2. Simple version of [Tanks](https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/81/268997-pockettanks.jpg), where the angle is determines by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed (tentative)
3. 2D Maze Generation with [Kruskal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) (tentative)
4. [Dijkstra shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 2d visualization (tentative)
