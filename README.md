# Challenges 

This repository holds a set of implementation to challenges that I'm coming up with for myself. The constraint I have placed on myself is that I can't use [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Chalenges:

1. Generate a 3d render of a generated terrain (working on)
** OS: Ubuntu
2. Dijkstra shortest path 2d visualization (tentative)
3. 2D Maze Generation with [Kruskal](link goes here) (tentative)
4. Simple version of [Tanks](link goes here), where the angle is determines by the mouse and the click length determines the power, and targets are randomly placed (tentative)
