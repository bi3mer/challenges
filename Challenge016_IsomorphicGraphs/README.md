# Isomorphism

I'm still a tad bit hesitant on whether or not this is a complete solution. My first solution I ended up finding being incorrect based on testing graphs 6 and 7. It now answers for those two correclty but I may have missed a case. Any feedback on whether or not I missed something would be appreciated. For now I'm going to count it as solved, but I'll likely come back to this in the future to see where I messed up.

## To Run

```bash
./main.py

```

## Graphs

Graphs 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are based on figures from [Applied Combinatorics](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Combinatorics-Alan-Tucker/dp/0470458380) in chapter 1.

Graphs 4 and 5 are based on the [wikipedia ariticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism).

The following pairings will be isomoprhic:

1. 1 and 2
2. 4 and 5
